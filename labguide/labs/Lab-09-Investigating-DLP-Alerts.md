# Lab 09 - Investigation of  Data Loss Prevention Alerts 

## Lab Overview
The main goal of the investigation stage is for the assigned owner to correlate evidence, determine the cause and full impact of the alert and decide on a remediation plan. The assigned owner is responsible for deeper investigation and remediation of the alert. The primary alert investigation tools are the Microsoft 365 Defender portal and the DLP alert management dashboard. You might also use Activity Explorer to investigate alerts. You can also share alerts with other users in your organization.

## Lab scenario

In this lab, the task involves navigating to the Microsoft Purview portal, specifically the DLP section, and exploring the generated alerts. The goal is to provide insights into investigating DLP alerts, understanding the available information, and utilizing tools like the DLP alert management dashboard and Activity Explorer for a comprehensive analysis.

### Task 1: Investigation of  Data Loss Prevention Alerts

In this task, you'll explore investigating DLP alerts in Microsoft Purview.

1. Within **cvm-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** RDP session, in **Microsoft Edge**, navigate back to the **[Microsoft Purview](https://compliance.microsoft.com/)** home page. 

1. In the **Microsoft Purview** portal, in the left navigation pane, expand **Data loss prevention** and select **Alerts (1)** and notice alerts have been generated you can view details for each alert.

   >**Note**: We would like to inform you that our Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy may take some time to trigger an alert, and in certain instances, it may not generate an alert randomly. Please proceed with the task at hand, keeping in mind that while the DLP policy is in place to enhance security, occasional delays or non-triggering of alerts can occur.

1. Select the Events tab to view all of the events associated with the alert. You can choose a particular event to view its details. For a list of some of the available event details, select one alert to check the details.

1. Select the **Overview** tab page for the alert. The overview page provides a summary:

   - of what happened
   - who performed the actions that caused the policy match
   - information about the matched policy, and more

1. Select the **Events** tab and access the following tab to review the details:

   - Event Details
   - Classifiers that detected a match
   - Metadata associated with the event

1. Back on the **Alerts** page, click on one of the alerts and select the User activity summary tab to see all of the exfiltration activities the user has engaged in up to the past 120 days.

   >**Note**: Users must be in the scope of an insider risk management policy to see the User activity summary tab.

    >**Note**: You Investigated the alert in the DLP alert management dashboard and also explored Activity Explorer to investigate alerts. You can also share alerts with other users in your organization.

### Conclusion:
The investigation of DLP alerts is a critical step in the data security lifecycle. It empowers organizations to respond effectively to potential threats, enhance data protection policies, and educate users on proper data handling practices. The ability to mark alerts as resolved signifies that appropriate actions have been taken to address the identified issues.
