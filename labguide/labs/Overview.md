## About the Sandbox

Using this environment, You'll be able to explore complete features and offerings offered by Microsoft Sentinel. Please find the detailed overview of the sandbox environment below.

### Pre-provisioned resources

#### **Virtual Machine**: 

- 1 *Windows 11* Virtual machine, virtual machine-related resources like Virtual networks, Network security groups, managed disks, Network interface cards, and IP addresses are deployed as part of the automation.

   These virtual machines are tailored and configured to the sandbox's specifications. Files, applications, packages, and OS configurations are all pre-configured. It is recommended that you use the same virtual machine throughout the lab for the best experience.

#### **License and subscription**: 

- You'll have access to a pre-configured Microsoft user account with an active Azure subscription, a tenant, and a Microsoft 365 E5 license assigned to the user. 
   
  User account has assigned as Owner at subscription and Global administrator at the tenant level. You need to use the same user account throughout the lab to get the most out of the lab. 

#### **Azure Credits**: 

- You have been given Azure credit of **$83 USD** which includes the running cost of pre-deployed Azure resources, license cost, and other Azure resources deployed while running through the lab.

  You will receive **cost alerts** to your registered email address at **50%/75%/90%/95%/100%** of the allotted Azure Credit is spent.

  You can visit the Azure Subscription page to check the current Azure credit spend and Analysis on the **Cost analysis** tab under the Cost Management option.

#### **Duration and Deletion of sandbox**:  

- The sandbox environment will be active for **30 days/720** hours from the time of registration. 
- The maximum allowed virtual machine uptime is only **40 hours**. It is recommended to deallocate the virtual machine when not in use.
- The virtual machine is set up with a custom feature called Idle start/stop. This custom package will check the virtual machine's idleness every **2 hours/120 minutes**. If the virtual machine is left idle for over 2 hours, a pop-up window will appear, prompting you to respond. If you do take action within 10 minutes, the virtual machine will shut down automatically.  This feature is enabled in virtual machines to optimize Azure costs.
- when 100% of Azure credits are spent, the sandbox environment will get automatically deleted without any prior notification. To retain the environment for a longer period and to get the most out of the environment, please follow the best practices mentioned below.

#### **Best practices**: 

- **Resources usage**: Please stop the virtual machines and other resources when not in use to minimize the Azure spend.
  
- **Azure Cost Analysis**: Maintain a practice of checking the Cost Analysis report of the assigned Azure subscription often in check the Azure spending so that the environment can be retained for a longer duration of time.

- **Alert notifications**: Make sure to check your registered email's inbox for any alert-related mails. Alerts give you can head start to keep your Azure spending in control and to plan out the remaining credits in the best way possible.
