# Lab 16 - Configure Retention Policies

## Lab Overview

Retention policies are crucial components of information governance, allowing organizations to manage the lifecycle of their data, ensure compliance, and meet regulatory requirements. Here's an overview of the process to create and configure retention policies

## Lab scenario

In this lab, you'll use a retention policy to manage the data for your organization by deciding proactively whether to retain content, delete content, or retain and then delete the content. A retention policy lets you do this very efficiently by assigning the same retention settings at the container level to be automatically inherited by content in that container. 

In order to adhere to this law your organization has created a retention plan to retain all items in the organization for 3 months.

>**Note**: When you create and submit a retention policy, it can take up to seven days for the retention policy to be applied.

## Lab objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

+ Task 1: Create Retention Policy with Static mode
+ Task 2: Create Retention Policy with an Adaptive scope

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes
